Background:  

BIA Incorporated is an online sales company which operates out of ten different locations in Australia. In the recent past, company has experienced a drop in sales. They have not been able to make any profit lately. Hence, the need to consolidate its operation and adopt some cost cutting measures. In order facilitate this process, the company wishes to undertake a performance evaluation exercise. As a result of the prior business Intelligence gathering initiative BIA now has a database which is used for sales reporting. The company would like to explore the option of enhancing its database such that it can perform some additional performance evaluation and monitoring on the sales data.  

Objective 

This report proposes an enhancement to the existing data model to enable analysis and reporting at location level. Additionally, it aims to provide report on recent sales trends, some predictions of sales in the next year. It also attempts to identify the most and least popular sold items in each store and for the company. In the final section of the report tries to provide ranking to the Offices based on its sales performance and some suggestion around which office can be closed. This report is to be presented to CIO at BIA Inc. 

Major Findings: 

When measured based on overall KPI, the Wagga Wagga branch is determined to be top performing location while Dubbo is ranked at the bottom. 

The forecasted sale for the whole company for next year is $12,610,000.  

The most in demand item is mitre saw whereas the least sold item is drill bit 6mm for the company as a whole 

Recommendations 

Perform descriptive and predictive analysis on sales data over a longer period of time, not just one year and reconcile the findings. 

Close Dubbo office/store location for BIA Inc as it is ranked as least performing when measured against overall KPI 

Capture more data for analysis and identifying trends. (e.g., customer interaction, expenses, marketing expenses etc.)  

Identify the best and worst selling items from the analysis and take drastic decision in stocking those items.  

Actively follow the KPI analysis (if possible, quarterly) in monitoring each branches’ performance.
