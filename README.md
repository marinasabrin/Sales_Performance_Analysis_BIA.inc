**Background**

BIA Incorporated is an online sales company operating from ten locations in Australia. The company has experienced a recent downturn in sales and has failed to make a profit, prompting a need to consolidate operations and implement cost-cutting measures. To facilitate this process, BIA has initiated a performance evaluation exercise. With the help of its existing sales reporting database, BIA seeks to enhance its data model to conduct more detailed performance analysis and monitoring.  

**Objective** 

The primary goal of this report is to propose enhancements to the existing data model to allow analysis and reporting at the location level. Additionally, the report aims to identify recent sales trends, predict sales for the next year, determine the most and least popular items across the company, and rank the locations based on sales performance. Ultimately, the findings and recommendations in this report will guide decision-making, including the potential closure of underperforming offices. 

**Major Findings**

- **Top Performing Location:** The Wagga Wagga branch is ranked as the top-performing location based on overall Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
- **Least Performing Location:** The Dubbo branch is identified as the lowest-ranking location.
- **Sales Forecast for Next Year:** The projected sales for BIA Incorporated for the upcoming year are $12,610,000.
- **Most Popular Item:** The mitre saw is identified as the best-selling item across the company.
- **Least Popular Item:** The least sold item is the 6mm drill bit. 

**Recommendations**

- **Descriptive and Predictive Analysis:** Conduct extended analysis on sales data over multiple years to better understand trends and ensure accurate forecasts.
- **Closure of Dubbo Office:** Consider closing the Dubbo location due to its consistent underperformance against KPIs.
- **Expand Data Collection:** Gather more comprehensive data, such as customer interactions, expenses, and marketing costs, to support more informed analysis and decision-making.
- **Review Product Stocking:** Based on the analysis of best and worst-selling items, adjust inventory to optimize sales performance.
- **Regular Performance Monitoring:** Implement a quarterly review process to monitor branch performance against KPIs, allowing for timely corrective actions.

The findings and recommendations presented in this report will guide BIA Incorporated's strategic decisions regarding sales performance, branch operations, and inventory management, contributing to the company's overall profitability and sustainability.
